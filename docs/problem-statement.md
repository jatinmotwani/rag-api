# Problem Statement (Learning Project)

I want to learn how RAG systems work end-to-end by building a local, zero-cost stack.

## Learning Goals
- Understand ingestion, parsing, chunking, embeddings, and retrieval.
- Experiment with chunk sizes, overlap, and retrieval strategies.
- Ground answers with citations and measure faithfulness.
- Build intuition for quality vs. latency tradeoffs.

## Constraints
- Run fully local using Ollama models and Docker containers.
- No paid APIs or cloud services.
- Single-user, non-production scope.

## Definition of Success
- I can ingest a small set of documents and ask questions with cited answers.
- I can explain the pipeline and debug failures.
- I can change components and observe the impact.

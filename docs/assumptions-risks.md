# Assumptions and Risks (Learning Project)

## Assumptions
- The machine can run small Ollama models.
- Documents are small enough to fit local storage.
- The goal is learning, not performance.

## Risks
- Model quality may be inconsistent.
- Hardware limitations can slow ingestion and queries.
- Parsing PDFs is messy and may fail.

## Mitigations
- Start with a small model and a tiny dataset.
- Use smaller chunk sizes to reduce memory usage.
- Build a small evaluation set to validate changes.

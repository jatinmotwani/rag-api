# Security and Privacy (Local Learning)

## Data Handling
- Keep all data local on your machine.
- Avoid sensitive or confidential documents.
- Do not expose the service to the public internet.

## Good Habits to Practice
- Use separate folders for raw vs. processed data.
- Keep logs local and rotate if needed.
- If you later share the repo, remove sample data.
